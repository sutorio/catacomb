References can be managed by a tool such as [Zotero](https:://zotero.org). This then in turn can be used for citations & bibliographies. Handling this up-front is going to help in the long-run and avoids the "massive pile of vaguely-sorted bookmarks issue" I currently have. Also means I don't have to keep tabs open. Or painstakingly list every tab I'm currently using in a `README` _&c_.

Zotero seems like the best choice, although lack of support (as of ) for current Android is a pain in the ass.
