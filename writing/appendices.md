*Non-essential* supplementary information. The core information should be in the text. An appendix is there to ensure that the flow of the core text is not broken.

In terms of technical articles, detailed textual descriptions would be an example of something that should probably go into an appendix. So for example, when describing one of the [[dictionary parsers]], then the detailed textual description of the syntactic structure could be an appendix, with a [[railroad diagram]] in the core text.
